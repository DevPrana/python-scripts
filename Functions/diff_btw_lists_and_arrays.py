'''
We know that an array is a multidimensional collection of numbers.
Python doesn't have built-in support for arrays but we can use numpy module
to create arrays.

A python 'list' is similar to an array, with the added functionality of
being able to add elements of datatype other than integers/floating point numbers

Because of this added functionality, arrays are faster to make calculations with
in python.
IMPORTANT for competitive programming.

NOTE that python lists are mutable so most list methods mutate the list without
the need of reassignment. Only a handful of functions require re-assignment.
