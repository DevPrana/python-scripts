#Bitwise Operators

#Left Shift
print(2<<3)
'''
Binary representation of 2 is 0010
If we left shift all the bits, all bits will move left.

Left shift will be 0100 which is 4.

If left shift is occurring, when the number of bits to be limited to 4, the leftmost bit will come to the starting position
'''
#Right Shift
print(1>>2)

'''
Binary representation of 1 is 0001
If we right shift all the bits, all bits will move right.

Right shift will be 0000 which is 0.
'''
#Bitwise XOR

print(5^2)
'''
Binary representation of 2 is 0010
Binary representation of 5 is 0101

5^2 will be 0111 or 7
